This is the StarVal test suite.

It contains:

  o  brief description of the StAR format (StAR.txt)
  o  a XSD for validating XML data (star.xsd)
  o  a validation suite for validating XML data  (Makefile, which uses star.xsd and xmllint)
  o  several example documents that illustrate the format (star-*.xml.gz)

To use the validation suite, do

  make test      --- check all .xml and .xml.gz files in current directory
  make testegi   --- check all .xml and .xml.gz files in current directory against EGI profile
  make testclean --- clean up after running the tests
  make clean     --- more aggressive cleaning: removes backup files from editor
